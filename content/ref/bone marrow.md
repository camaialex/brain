(Back to [[primary lymphatic organs]])

# Bone Marrow

## Structure
- Made of [[collagen IV]]
- Vascular
	- Arteries branch into **capillary-venous sinuses**
		- Endothelium + basement membrane + adventitial layer
	- Blood eventually collects into **central vein**
	- Restricts flow of cells out of the bone marrow; only **mature cells can leave**
- Stromal cells
	- Produce colony growth factors 
	- [[macrophage]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s, [[fibroblast]]s, [[endothelial cell]]s
- Adhesion molecules
	- Restrict flow of cells out of the bone marrow; only **mature cells can leave**
	- Localization of stem/progenitor cells to specific regions for differentiation
## Function
- Site of [[hematopoiesis]]
## Histology
### General Trends to Check
- Cellularity
- Myeloid:erythroid ratio 3:1
- "Field of flowers" - good variety/mixture of different lineage precursors
- Megakaryocytes
- Iron - [[Prussian blue stain]] highlights stores within [[macrophage]]s
- Pathology
	- [[scar|fibrosis]]
	- Tumor metastases
	- [[granuloma]]s
