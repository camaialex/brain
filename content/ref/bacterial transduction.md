# Bacterial Transduction

- Process by which bacteria exchange genetic material through infection by a [[virus]]
- Transduction can be _nonrandom_
	- General: random bits of bacterial DNA are picked up and reincorporated by the virus
	- Specialized: DNA near the viral insertion site is preferentially transferred
		- Ex. Shiga toxin, diptheria toxin, cholera toxin
