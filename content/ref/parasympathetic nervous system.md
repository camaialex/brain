(Back to [[autonomic nervous system]])

# Parasympathetic Nervous System

The Para-SNS controls "rest and digest" responses.
- Neurons bind [[acetylcholine]] on **muscarinic** receptors
## Gross Structure & Physiology

### Trends
- Presynaptic neurons originate in the **brainstem** (III, VII, IX, X) and **sacral** (S2-4) regions of the [[spinal cord]]
	- Called the **craniosacral** system
- Synapse in ganglia:
	- [[peripheral ganglia]]
	- target organ ganglia
- Often join [[trigeminal nerve]] branches to reach target organ ("hitchhiking")
- There is no parasympathetic innervation in the limbs
## Cholinergic Tone
- [[M1 cholinergic receptor]]
- [[M2 cholinergic receptor]]
- [[M3 cholinergic receptor]]
