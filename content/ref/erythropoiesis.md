# Erythropoiesis
Process of making new [[erythrocyte|RBC]]s. RBCs have a limited lifespan (120 days) and need to be replaced regularly.

A subcategory of [[hematopoiesis]].
## Process
1. Proerythroblast
	1. 18um
	2. Large nucleus with granular chromatin
	3. RNA-rich cytoplasm - stains blue with [[Wright stain]] and eosinophilic
2. Basophilic erythroblast
	1. 12-14um
	2. Basophilic cytoplasm
	3. Perinuclear halo
3. Polychromatophilic erythroblast
	1. Accumulation of [[hemoglobin]]
		1. Mixed with RNA, stains the cytoplasm muddy purple (POLYchromatophilic)
	2. Nuclear/chromatin condensation
4. Orthrochromatic erythroblast
	1. Accumulation of [[hemoglobin]]
		1. [[Wright stain]] is red-orange (ORTHOchromatophilic)
	2. Nucleus undergoing [[pyknosis]]
5. [[reticulocyte]]
	1. **Anucleate**
	2. Still contains ribosomes, mitochondria
		1. Supravital stain causes condensation of organelles into strands
6. [[erythrocyte]]
	1. 7-8um
	2. Ribosomes and RNA degraded
	3. [[Wright stain]] is red-orange
## B12 and folate
- [[cyanocobalamin]] and [[folate]] are essential for RBC maturation
	- Required to generate DNA precursors
- Deficiency causes cells to grow in size but arrest at **S phase**
	- Megaloblastic cells undergo apoptosis
