(Back to [[skeletal muscle]])

# Sarcomere

The **sarcomere** is the **functional unit** of skeletal muscle. It is made of three regions:
- I band: region of only [[actin]] filaments
- H zone: region of only [[myosin]] filaments
- A band: region encompassing entire length of [[myosin]] chain; contains some overlapping [[actin]]

Sarcomeres repeat end-to-end to form a [[myofibril]]
