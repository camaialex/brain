## Synaptic Pharmacology
- Acting at the presynaptic neuron
- Acting at the synapse
	- [[nicotinic receptor agonists]]
	- [[anti-cholinesterases]] - curare, neostigmine, relatives
	- [[depolarizing muscle relaxants]] - succinylcholine and Rocuronium, relatives
- Acting at the postsynaptic neuron/effector organ
	- Acting at muscarinic receptors (parasympathetic)
		- **These drugs aren't very useful because they have widespread impact**
