# Somatic Hypermutation

Process by which [[B cell]]s tune the affinity of their [[immunoglobulin]] by intentionally mutating the **variable region**.
## CDR and FR
- Certain regions of the variable chain gene are more prone to mutation
	- The epitope-binding residues are highly variable (**C**omplementarity-**d**etermining **r**egions)
	- The supporting residues of the chain are stable  (**F**ramework **r**egions)
