(Back to [[peripheral nervous system]])

# Spinal Nerves

## Structure
- Originate from the [[spinal cord]]
- Leave the vertebral column via **intervertebral foramen**
- Due to the way the spinal cord formed during embryogenesis:
	- The **cervical** spinal nerves are always _above_ their respective vertebrae
	- The **thoracic (and below)** spinal nerves are always _below_ their respective vertebrae
