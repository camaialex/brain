(Back to [[action potential]])

# Resting Membrane Potential

The **RMP** is the voltage difference across the membrane at equilibrium (resting state).
## The RMP
- The resting membrane potential is around **-70mV** in most cell membranes
## Maintenance
- The RMP is primarily maintained by the [[sodium-potassium pump]]
	- [[potassium leak channel]]s contribute as well
	- [[sodium leak channel]]s (somewhat) also contribute
## Chemistry
- The RMP is the result of the chemistry of all of the ions around the membrane
	- All ions want to achieve their own [[equilibrium potential]]
- **The ion with the highest conductivity across the membrane** has the heaviest influence on RMP
	- Conductivity is related to how many of that ion's channels are open
	- At RMP, **potassium** has the highest permeability due to leak channels
		- The RMP is therefore closest to potassium's **$E_{ion}$** of -80mV
