(Back to [[drug distribution]])

# Vd (Volume of Distribution)

The volume of distribution is the **volume of plasma** that would account for the amount of dissolved drug in the body when Ct = Cp (concentration of drug in plasma and tissue are equivalent)

Vd is made of the central compartment (Vc) and peripheral compartment (Vc) of the plasma.

Vd relates the dose to the observed plasma concentration
	Vd = dose / Cp

Depending on patient biology, Vd can vary significantly.
