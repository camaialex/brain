# Synapse
## Structure
- A synapse is a junction between a presynaptic neuron's axon and a postsynaptic neuron
## Synaptic Transmission
1. Action potential depolarization reaches the end of the presynaptic axon
2. Depolarization opens [[voltage-gated calcium channel]]s
3. Calcium floods into the presynaptic axon
4. Vesicles containing [[acetylcholine]] are triggered to bind to the axonal membrane
5. ACh enters the synaptic cleft
	   _[[acetylcholinesterase]] degrades a lot of the ACh before it reaches receptor.._
6. ACh binds the post-synaptic [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s on postsynaptic neuron
7. Nicotinic receptors open, allowing positive ions to enter postsynaptic neuron
8. Action potential propagates down next neuron
9. **Termination** of signal by [[acetylcholinesterase]]
## Synaptic Vesicle Docking
- Vesicle fusion is a high-energy process and must be catalyzed by proteins
### Components of Vesicle Fusion
- Vesicle
	- [[synaptotagmin]]: calcium sensor
	- [[synaptobrevin]]: interacts with membrane SNARE, complexes with
		- [[SNAP25]]
		- [[syntaxin]]
- Presynaptic membrane
	- [[SNARE]]: protein complex that pulls vesicle in and mediates fusion
### Mechanism 1: Complete fusion
- Vesicle fuses and releases neurotransmitter, joining the membrane
- Vesicle is recycled by clathrin
### Mechanism 2: Kiss-and-run
- Vesicle fuses and releases neurotransmitter but retains shape
- Vesicle re-pinches off
