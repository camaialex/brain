(Back to [[viral immune evasion]])

# Viral Evasion of Type 1 Interferons

- Viruses can shut down [[type 1 interferon]] signaling
## Mechanisms
- **Evasion**
	- Mask genome
	- Block receptor signaling
	- Block transcription
- **Inhibition** of IFN receptor
	- Degrade IFN receptor
	- Block receptor signaling
	- Block transcription/translation of ISG
