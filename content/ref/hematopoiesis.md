# Hematopoiesis

- Hematopoiesis is the creation of new blood cells
## Location
- **Fetal**
	- 0-3 months: [[yolk sac]]
	- 2-7 months: [[liver]] and [[spleen]]
	- Birth onwards: [[bone marrow]]
		- Becomes more and more focused on [[axial skeleton]] during maturation
## Process
### Stem Cell
- Begins with **hematopoietic progenitor cell**
	- Differentiates into **lymphoid and myeloid progenitor** lineages
- CFU-L: [[lymphoid lineage]]
	- Form lymphocytes and ILCs
- CFU-GEMM [[myeloid lineage]]
	- Form phagocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells, erythrocytes
	- Form platelets
- **Stem cells retain the ability to self-renew**
### Progenitor Cell
- Myeloid lineage
	- CFU-GM
	- CFU-G
	- CFU-M
	- BFU-E --> CFU-E
	- CFU-Meg
	- CFU-Eo
	- CFU-Baso
- **Progenitor cells are irreversibly committed to a particular lineage**
### Precursor Cell
- **Precursor cells lose the ability to self-renew and must form mature cells**
## Hematopoietic Growth Factors
- [[erythropoietin]] - stimulates differentiation of [[erythrocyte|RBC]]
- [[thrombopoietin]] - stimulates differentiation of [[platelet]] 
- [[G-CSF]] - stimulates differentiation of [[neutrophil]]
- [[M-CSF]] - stimulates differentiation of [[monocyte]] and therefore macrophages
- [[IL-3]] - stimulates differentiation of [[basophil]]
- [[IL-5]] - stimulates differentiation of [[eosinophil]]
