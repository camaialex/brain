# Secondary Hemostasis

The **end goal** is the formation of **fibrin** mesh to hold the platelet plug together.
## Process
### Initiation
- Coagulation is usually activated by the [[extrinsic coagulation pathway]]
	- Alternately, initiation factors prekallikrein, FXII, and HMWK come in _contact_ with negatively charged activators (collagen, foreign bodies like glass) (direct [[intrinsic coagulation pathway]] activation)
2. Circulating **FVIIa** comes in contact with **tissue factor** externalized by damaged endothelium (usual pathway) forming the **extrinsic Xase**
3. Extrinsic Xase localizes to membrane
4. Extrinsic Xase cleaves **FIX** and **FX**
5. FXa cleaves small amount of **thrombin**
	1. Triggers a large chain reaction mediated by thrombin
### Amplification
1. Thrombin helps form the HIGHLY efficient **intrinsic Xase** (FIXa-FVIIIa)
	1. Cleaves **FXI** (can generate FIXa)
	2. Cleaves **FVIII** (creates cofactor for FIXa)
2. Thrombin helps create **prothrombinase**
	1. Cleaves **FV** (cofactor for FXa)
### Propagation
1. Large amounts of prothrombinase cause **thrombin burst**
	1. FXa-FVa cleaves **FII** (prothrombin) to FIIA (thrombin)
2. Thrombin initiates the **fibrin mesh**
	1. Cleaves **FI** (fibrinogen) to FIA (fibrin)
		1. Cleavage of fibrinopeptide A and B
		2. Conformational change that exposes binding site on E domain
		3. Overlap of D domain and E domain of fibrin molecules
	2. Cleaves **FXIII**
3. FXIIIa D-D crosslinks fibrin monomers
## Vitamin K
- Vitamin K is required for **carboxylation** of several key factors in secondary hemostasis
	- [[FII]]
	- [[FVII]]
	- [[FIX]]
	- [[FX]]
## Defects
- Hemophilia - disrupts **intrinsic pathway** (Prekallikrein/HMWK/FXII-FXI-FIX-FVIII)
	- [[hemophilia A]] - deficiency of FVIII
	- [[hemophilia B]] - deficiency of FIX
	- [[hemophilia C]] - deficiency of FIX
	- Importantly, **deficiencies in FXII do not result in clinically significant bleeding**
- Extrinsic pathway deficiencies
	- Congenital [[FVII deficiency]]
- Hypercoagulation diseases
	- [[Factor V Leiden]]
- [[vitamin K deficiency]]
	- Affects II, VII, IX, and V
