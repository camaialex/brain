# Plasmablast
---
## Lineage
- 

## Biology
- Plasmablasts are immature B-cells that rapidly expand at the beginning of an immune response.
- They are capable of internalizing and presenting antigen.
- They manufacture massive amounts of antibodies (far more than plasma cells) but are short-lived, either dying or differentiating into [[plasma cell]]s.
