# Affinity Maturation

### Primary Focus
1. Following activation, B cells proliferates and moves to the medulla of lymph node to engage in effector function
### Affinity Maturation
1. Some B cells, after activation, move to [[germinal center]]s in the cortex
2. B cells expand and undergo [[somatic hypermutation]] to slightly modify BCRs
3. B cells test their modified BCR with [[follicular dendritic cell]] and [[follicular helper T-cell|Tfh]] help
4. Successful B cells that are non-self-reactive survive and leave the lymph node
5. B cells undergo differentiation and [[class-switching]]
