# Opsonization

Opsonization involves covering a suspect pathogen in particles, or **opsonins**, which facilitate immune action against them.
## Types of Opsonization
- Opsonization by [[immunoglobulin]], facilitating [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity]]
- Opsonization by [[C3b]] and [[C4b]] facilitates [[phagocyte|phagocytosis]]
