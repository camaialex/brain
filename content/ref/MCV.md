(Back to [[CBC]])

# Mean Corpuscular Volume
The mean volume of an RBC in a [[CBC]]
## Methodology
### Aperture Impedance
_(Coulter Principle)_
- MCV can be measured directly by analyzing the magnitude of the voltage pulses
### Indirect Measurement
- MCV is indirectly measured by:
	- [[hematocrit]] - total packed RBC volume
	- [[RBC count]] - total number of RBCs
- Therefore MCV = Hct / RBC
## Normal Range
- This will vary by lab
- Typically, MCV ranges from 80-100 fL
