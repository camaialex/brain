(Back to [[megaloblastic anemia]])

# B12 Deficiency

## Presentation
- Anemia
	- Fatigue, headache, dizziness, SOB
- Jaundice due to hemolysis
- Glossitis (tongue swelling)
## Etiology
- Deficiency in [[cyanocobalamin]]
- Impaired DNA synthesis leading to megaloblasts
	- S phase arrest
	- Cytoplasmic growth
	- Cell death in bone marrow
## Diagnosis
### CBC
- Megaloblastic anemia (increased [[MCV]])
- Accompanying [[thrombocytopenia]] and/or [[leukopenia]]
- Decreased [[reticulocyte count]]
- Hypersegmented [[neutrophil]]s
### Hemolysis
- Increased [[bilirubin]]
- Increased [[LDH]]
### Metabolite Buildup
- Increased [[homocysteine]]
- Increased [[methylmalonic acid]]
## Complications
- Neurological
	- Dorsolateral spinal cord demyelination
	- Numbness or tingling in extremities
	- Impaired proprioception
- Folate deficiency may **mask** [[B12 deficiency]] with similar symptoms
	- If B12 deficiency is treated as folate deficiency, patient will deteriorate
## Treatment
- Supplemental B12 infusions - [[intramuscular]]
	- Especially if patient is showing neurological symptoms
