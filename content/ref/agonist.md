(Back to [[drug-receptor theory]])

# Agonist

- A drug that _binds_ to a receptor and triggers a _signaling cascade_ mimicking the action of an _endogenous signaling molecule_

## Subcategories
- [[full agonist]] - agonist that triggers a complete physiological response compared to endogenous
- [[partial agonist]] - agonist that triggers a similar but _weaker_ physiological response compared to endogenous
