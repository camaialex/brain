# Antibiotic Atlas

## Classes of Antibiotics
- Cell wall synthesis inhibitors
	- [[penicillins]]
	- [[cephalosporins]]
	- [[vancomycin]]
- Protein synthesis inhibitors
	- [[macrolides]]
	- [[clindamycin]]
	- [[tetracyclines]]
	- [[aminoglycosides]]
- DNA replication inhibitors
	- [[fluoroquinolones]]
	- [[nitroimidazole]]
	- [[sulfonamides]]
## Toxicity and Adverse Effects
- [[selective toxicity]]
- Some antibiotics _do_ have host toxicity
	- **Gentamicin**: accumulates in inner ear and renal brush
		- Ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity
	- **Doxycycline**: accumulates in the bone
		- Osteopathy and tooth discoloration
- [[superinfection]]
## Antibiotic Resistance
- Bacteria evade antibiotics by:
	- _Changing_ the target
	- _Changing_ the antibiotic
	- Expressing [[p-glycoprotein]] to efflux drugs
	- _Inactivating_ the antibiotic
	- _Reducing_ premeability
## Susceptibility Testing
- [[broth dilution]]
- [[disc diffusion]]
