# Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)

Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) is essential for DNA synthesis.
## Sources
- Main dietary source is **animal-derived**
- Plants do not contribute - vegan diet can lead to deficiency
## Absorption
1. mouth
	1. B12 binds [[transcobalamin 1]] which protects it from acid
2. stomach
	1. Stomach releases [[intrinsic factor]] (IF) via [[parietal cell]]s
3. duodenum
	1. B12 binds IF after releasing transcobalamin
4. terminal [[ileum]]
	1. B12-IF is taken up into body
	2. B12 is bound to [[transcobalamin 2]]
5. Distribution
	1. Target tissues
	2. [[liver]] storage
## Deficiency
- Caused by
	- [[pernicious anemia]] - autoimmune antibodies against IF and parietal cells
	- Gastric bypass
	- Surgical resection of terminal ileum
	- [[inflammatory bowel disease]]
- Can lead to [[megaloblastic anemia]] with peripheral neuropathy (parasthesias)
- Since body stores of B12 are large, deficiency can take **years** to develop
	- Liver stores 2-5mg
	- Body uses 3ug / day
