# Platelet

Platelets are _anuclear_ cell fragments that play key roles in [[ref/hemostasis|hemostasis]]
- 2-3 microns
- Lifespan 9-10 days
## Development
Derived from [[megakaryocyte]]s
1. **Megakaryoblasts** undergo **endoreduplication** (replication and growth without division)
2. **Promegakaryocytes** accumulates granules and expands membrane
3. Platelets bud off of the **megakaryocyte** membrane
## Structure/Function
- Activation
	- [[P2Y12]], [[P2Y1]] - ADP receptors
	- [[PAR1]], [[PAR2]] - [[FIIa]] receptors
	- [[TBXA2R]] - [[TXA2]] receptor
		- [[PLA2]] - frees AA mediated by [[Ca2+]] binding
		- [[PTGS1]], [[COX-2]], [[TBXA2S1]] - form thromboxane A2
- Adhesion - stick to the wound ([[ref/primary hemostasis|primary hemostasis]])
	- [[GPIb-V-IX]] - binds vWF and collagen
	- [[GPVI]] - binds collagen
	- [[GPIa-IIa]] - binds collagen
	- beta-1 integrins - bind collagen, laminin, fibronectin
- Aggregation - stick to each other ([[ref/primary hemostasis|primary hemostasis]])
	- [[GPIIb-IIIa]] - binds vWF and collagen
- Interface with [[secondary hemostasis]]
	- [[phosphatidylserine]] - when externalized, interfaces with [[intrinsic Xase]]
- Granules
	- Surface-connected canalicular system - tunnels that granules are released from
	- [[alpha granule]]s - include adhesive factors like vWF and fibrinogen
	- [[dense granule]]s - include activating factors like ADP, Ca2+, serotonin
