# Hemophilia A

## Presentation
- MSK bleeds
	- Hemarthroses
	- Muscle bleed
	- Intracranial hemorrhage
- Epistaxis
## Etiology
- Deficiency in [[FVIII]]
	- Severe: <1% function remaining
	- Moderate: 1-5%
	- Mild: 5-40% 
- **[[X-linked]] recessive inheritance**
	- Females can express mild hemophilia as carriers through varied [[X lyonization]]
## Diagnosis
- Significant family history of disease
- Coagulation dysregulation
	- Increased PTT
## Complications
- Development of **factor inhibitors** - antibodies to the transfused factor replacement
## Treatment
- Factor replacement
- Emicizumab
- DDAVP
	- Ineffective against severe hemophilia
- Antifibrinolytic therapy

For [[factor inhibitor]] development:
- Recombinant FVIIa therapy
- FEIBA for inhibitor development
	- Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Agent
