# X-ray

## How it works
- X-rays shot through subject onto **film**
	- X-rays are blocked based on _properties of material_
- Different tissue show up as [[radiopaque]] and [[radiolucent]]

## Positioning
- Body X-rays
	- Always positioned as if _facing you_ (left and right are inverted)
- Appendage X-rays
	- Positioned as if _you're looking at your own appendage_

## Views
- Frontal view: face-on
	- Antero-posterior: rays shot from front to back
	- Postero-anterior: rays show from back to front
- Lateral view: side-on
- Oblique: at a non-square angle
