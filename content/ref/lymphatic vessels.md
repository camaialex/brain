(Back to [[secondary lymphatic organs]])

# Lymphatic Vessels

## Function
- _Collect_ and _return_ interstitial fluid/lymph and immune cells from tissues
- Conduct lymph through the body
- Carry [[APC]]s and **antigen** to the other [[secondary lymphatic organs]]

## Structure
- Lymph
	- Also known as interstitial fluid
	- Fluid that leaves the blood and bathes tissues
	- Resembles plasma with fewer soluble proteins
	- Milky color due to [[chylomicrons]] absorbed from [[GI Atlas|digestive system]]
- **Valves** prevent backflow
- Pathway of lymph through the body
	1. Lymphatic capillaries
	2. Collective vessels
	3. Right lymphatic duct
	4. Thoracic duct
