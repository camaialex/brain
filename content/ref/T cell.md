# T Cell

## Lineage
- Hematopoietic: [[CD45|CD45]]+ 
	- T-cell: [[CD3|CD3]]+ 
## Structure
- [[TCR]] - how T cells recognize antigen
- Forms part of immune synapse
	- [[LFA-1]]
	- [[CD28]]
	- [[CD2]]
## Development
- Initial development in the [[bone marrow]]
- Maturation occurs in [[thymus]]
- 98% of developing T-cells are selected against
## Activation
- [[T cell activation]] occurs within [[secondary lymphatic organs]] at first exposure to APC
- [[T cell suppression]] occurs at second exposure to APC
## Subtypes
- [[helper T cell|Helper T-cell]]
- [[cytotoxic T cell|Cytotoxic T-cell]]
## Immunology
- [[adaptive immune system]] - cell-mediated immunity
- When mature, patrols **secondary lymphoid structures** in search of cognate antigen
	- Recognizes antigen in the context of [[MHC-I]]
## Pathology
- Impaired ability to fight viral pathogens
## Histology
- Large, dark, circular nucleus
- Very little cytoplasm
