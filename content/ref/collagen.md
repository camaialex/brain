## Formation of Collagen
1. Translation of pro-alpha chains
2. Hydroxylation of proline and lysine
3. Spontaneous formation of triple helices of pro-alpha chains
4. Export to extracellular space
5. Crosslinking triple helices to form fiber
## Subtypes of Collagen
- [[collagen I]] - fibers
- [[collagen II]] - cartilage
- [[collagen III]] - spleen, liver, lymph nodes
