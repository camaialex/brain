# Erythrocyte (RBC)

Erythrocytes are responsible for delivering oxygen to tissues throughout the body.
## Characteristics
- Anuclear, few organelles
- Maximizes surface area through **biconcave disc** shape
## Development
- 
## Cytoskeleton
- Hexagonal lattice of [[spectrin]] polymers (alpha/beta heterotetramer)
	- Hereditary defects in the connectivity of spectrin results in [[hereditary elliptocytosis]]
- Linkage points for spectrin on [[ankyrin]] and [[actin junctional complex]] proteins
	- Both linkage points connect spectrin to [[Band3]] membrane protein on the cell membrane
	- Hereditary defects in the connectivity of these junctions results in [[hereditary spherocytosis]]
## Cell Membrane
- RBCs require lots of energy to maintain an **asymmetric cell membrane**
	- Ion transporters like Band3 maintain help maintain cytosolic viscosity
	- [[phosphatidylserine]] (PS) is kept internal and is a signal of RBC aging when externalized
- [[glycophorin]] proteins (-) provide electrostatic repulsion between RBCs
	- Also provide
- [[ABO antigen]]s contribute to blood groups
## Metabolism
- Energetics are particularly important in RBC physiology
	- **No mitochondria**
	- Requires lots of ATP to maintain cellular shape
	- Requires antioxidant protection
### Energy production
- Relies solely on [[glycolysis]] (Embden-Meyerhoff Pathway)
### Antioxidant protection
- Glucose is shunted off of glycolysis through the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]
	- [[G6PD]] converts glucose to 6-phosphogluconate, reducing [[NADP+]] to [[NADPH]]
	- NADPH helps to reduce [[glutathione]] to [[reduced glutathione]]
	- Reduced glutathione can detoxify [[reactive oxygen species]]
## Oxygen Delivery
- RBCs rely on [[hemoglobin]] to carry and deliver oxygen
