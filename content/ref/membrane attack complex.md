# Membrane Attack Complex

([[C5b]], [[C6]], [[C7]], [[C8]], [[C9]])

The **MAC** perforates a pathogen's membrane, causing lysis via loss of osmotic balance. It is composed of 5 proteins that _embed_ within the membrane.
- This is especially important for the killing of [[Gram-negative bacteria]]; Gram-positive bacteria have a thick cell wall that resists MAC formation.
