# Action Potential

## 1. Resting Membrane Potential
- The [[resting membrane potential]] (RMP) is maintained by the [[sodium-potassium pump]] at **-70mV**
- A certain [[threshold potential]] is required to proceed, usually **-55mV**
	- [[synaptic potential]]s and [[receptor potential]]s may stimulate the postsynaptic neuron to build towards threshold
## 2. Depolarization
- If the **threshold potential** is reached, [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s open.
- Sodium floods into the cell.
- The membrane potential rises.
## 3. Repolarization
- At **+40mV**, [[voltage-gated potassium channel]]s open
- Sodium channels will become _inhibited_, beginning the [[absolute refractory period]]
- Potassium floods out of the cell.
- The membrane potential falls.
## 4. Hyperpolarization (overshoot)
- Potassium channels begin (but are _slow_) to close
- Membrane potential _overshoots_ the RMP, beginning the [[relative refractory period]]
## 5. Refractory Period
- The Na/K pump works to bring the hyperpolarized membrane back to RMP
