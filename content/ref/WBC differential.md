#MED

(Back to [[CBC]])

# WBC Differential

Relative proportions of different [[leukocyte]] lineages in the blood.
## Normal Values
- [[neutrophil]]s: 
	- segmented cells:
	- [[band cell]]s:
- [[eosinophil]]s: 
- [[basophil]]s: 
- [[monocyte]]s: 
- [[lymphocyte]]s: 
## Measurement
### Aperture Impedance
_(Coulter Principle)_
- An aperture of known dimensions creates a **known electrical voltage**
- Cells _change_ the voltage when they are passed through
	- Magnitude of voltage change provides information on type of cell
	- Number of voltage pulses = number of cells
### Light Scattering
- Light sources are scattered against cells
	- Forward scatter
	- Narrow-angle scatter
	- Wide-angle scatter
- These scatter data are correlated with the size and shape of the cell
### Flow Cytometry
- Specific antibodies can be used to phenotype cells
### Cytochemistry
- Peroxidase substrate is metabolized by [[neutrophil]]s, [[eosinophil]]s, and [[monocyte]]s
- Can be combined with light scatter to phenotype the cell
- Basophils phenotyped by resistance to acidic cytoplasmic stripping
