# Lectin-Binding Complement Pathway

## Process
1. Mannose-binding lectin ([[MBL]]) binds to mannose
2. MBL recruits [[MASP1]] and [[MASP2]]
3. MBL cleaves [[C2]] and [[C4]], forming [[C3 convertase]] (C4b2a)
   _The rest of this pathway resembles the classical pathway_
4. C3 convertase converts [[C3]] to [[C3b]], releasing anaphylatoxin [[C3a]]
5. C3 convertase associates with one C3b to become [[C5 convertase]] (C4b2a3b)
6. C5 convertase converts [[C5]] to [[C5b]], releasing anaphylatoxin [[C5a]]
7. C5b associates with C6-9 to form the [[membrane attack complex]]
