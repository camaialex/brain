# Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin (Hb) is a protein that carries oxygen throughout the body.
## Normal Structure
- (Adult) hemoglobin is a **heterotetramer** made of
	- 2 alpha globin chains, each with a [[heme]] group
	- 2 non-alpha globin chains, each with a [[heme group]]
		- 2 beta chains: [[hemoglobin A1]]
		- 2 delta chains: [[hemoglobin A2]]
		- 2 gamma chains: [[hemoglobin F]]
## Catabolism
- At the end of RBC lifespan (~120 days), heme is broken down along with the cell itself
	- Iron must be handled in a very specific way to avoid toxicity
	- **Globin chains** are digested
	- **Heme** is converted to biliverdin then [[bilirubin]]
		- Bilirubin is conjugated
## During Development
- General trends
	- **Epsilon and zeta globin** starts high and drops off
	- **Alpha globin** quickly increases and stays high for rest of life
	- **Beta globin** starts low and increases in adulthood
	- **Gamma globin** starts high and decreases in adulthood
- Embryonic hemoglobins
	- Zeta2Epsilon2
	- Alpha2Epsilon2
	- Zeta2Gamma2
	- Zeta2Beta2
- Fetal hemoglobins
	- Alpha2Gamma2
- Adult hemoglobins
	- Minor: Alpha2Delta2
	- Full adult: Alpha2Beta2
### Locus Control Region
- The LCR is an upstream DNA regulatory region on Chr11 that regulates globin switching
	- **Fetal**: LCR preferentially associates with gamma promoter
	- **Adult**: [[Bcl11a]] and [[ZBTB7a]] bind gamma promoter; LCR associates instead with beta
## Oxygen Dissociation Curve
- Binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is _cooperative_
	- Results in sigmoidal binding curve
	- Binding of an oxygen molecule facilitates the binding of others
