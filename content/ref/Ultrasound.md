# Ultrasound (US)

- Images tissue by detecting reverberations of _ultrasonic sound waves_
	- Sound waves bounce off tissues differently depending on density
	- Materials can be [[anechoic]], [[hypoechoic]] and [[hyperechoic]] directly related to tissue density
		- Bones are the most _echogenic_, followed by muscle, fat, water, and air which appear dark

## Orientation
- Top of image: where probe emanates

## Benefits and Drawbacks
- (+) Cheap
- (+) Easily deployable
- (+) Low-risk to pregnant mother and baby
- (+) Fast
- (-) Does not capture bone well
- (-) Operator-dependent results
- (-) Image quality
