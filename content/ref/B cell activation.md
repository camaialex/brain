(Back to [[B cell]])

# B Cell Activation

### Activation - Thymus-Independent
1. PRR or BCR bind/crosslink conserved antigen
2. Activation proceeds - **no memory generated**
### Activation - Thymus-Dependent
1. BCR binds antigen
	1. BCR must **crosslink** (two BCR bind one antigen)
	2. BCR associates with [[ITAM]] (CD79a/CD79b) to initiate signal cascade
	3. **This is the only signal needed for memory B cells**
2. BCR binds [[CD40L]] on a [[helper T cell|Th]] cell using [[CD40]] protein in [[lymph node]]
	1. B cells and Th cells exhibit [[linked recognition]]
	2. **Anergy** occurs in **naive** B cells when there is no CD40L costimulation
3. B cell receives stimulation by cytokines ([[IL-2]], [[IL-4]])
