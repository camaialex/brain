(Back to [[pharmacokinetics]])

# Drug Excretion

- **Large, highly charged, polar** drugs are likely to be excreted through the [[kidneys]] and the urinary system
	- **Nonpolar, lipophilic** drugs are likely to be excreted via the biliary system (see Mechanism[3])
## Clearance
- CL = variable used to measure how fast drug is cleared from body
## Mechanism of Clearance
Elimination of drug from cell
- Expression of [[p-glycoprotein]] to efflux xenobiotics and drugs
Renal excretion
1. All drugs **not bound to protein** are filtered in the glomerulus
2. Drugs are selectively excreted via active transport
3. **Lipophilic** drugs are passively reabsorbed into the blood due to mass-action
## Renal Dosing
- Renal clearance depends on **eGFR** (how fast the kidney filters blood)
- If kidneys are impaired (ex. nephritis), must consider decreased clearance
