(Back to [[autonomic nervous system]])

# Sympathetic Nervous System

The SNS controls the "fight or flight" response.
- Neurons selectively bind [[catecholamines]] on **adrenergic** receptors
## Gross Structure & Physiology
- High ratio of **post**ganglionic to *pre*ganglionic neurons
	- Allows for discharge as large units
### Trends
- Presynaptic neurons originate in the **thoracic** and **lumbar** regions (T1-L2) of the [[spinal cord]]
	- Called "thoracolumbar system"
- Synapse in ganglia:
	- [[paravertebral ganglia]] (sympathetic chain)
	- [[prevertebral ganglia]]
	- [[adrenal medulla]]
- All nerves to the limbs have sympathetic fibers
- Sympathetic neurons synapse at the level that they effect tissues
## Adrenergic Receptors
- SNS generally _does not_ contribute adrenergic tone **EXCEPT** in the blood vessels.
- [[alpha 1 adrenergic receptor]]
- [[alpha 2 adrenergic receptor]]
- [[beta 1 adrenergic receptor]]
- [[beta 2 adrenergic receptor]]
