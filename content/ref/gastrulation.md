(Back to [[embryonic development]])

# Gastrulation

- Week 3
- Formation of the trilaminar germ layer
- Caudal agenesis at this stage is likely nonviable

## Steps in Gastrulation
1. [[oropharyngeal membrane]] (OPM) and [[cloacal membrane]] (CM) form on cranial and caudal ends of disc
2. [[primitive streak]] forms at CM
	- Primitive streak epiblast cells create a third intermediate germ layer
	- **The structure is now known as the [[trilaminar germ disc]]**
3. [[primitive node]] at cranial end of primitive streak gives rise to [[notochord]]
	- Primitive node also creates body polarity and symmetry
4. The embryonic body axis and polarity is now established.
