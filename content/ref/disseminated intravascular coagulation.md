# Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation

## Presentation
- Systemic activation of coagulation
- Widespread clot formation
## Etiology
- Procoagulative states cause DIC
	- Infection
		- Renal failure
	- Cancer ([[tissue factor]] expression)
		- Thrombosis (solid tumors)
		- Bleeding (blood cancers)
	- Trauma exposing procoagulant
		- Thrombosis
	- Obstetric complications
		- Thrombosis
	- Vascular malformations
		- Bleeding
	- Transfusion reaction
- Release of cytokines inhibits anticoagulation and fibrinolysis
	- Through consumption, inhibition, immune destruction, among other mechanisms
	- [[antithrombin]]
	- [[protein C]]
	- [[tissue factor pathway inhibitor]]
	- [[plasminogen activation inhibitor 1]]
## Diagnosis
- Pertinent negatives
- Excessive coagulation/consumption
	- Elevated PT and PTT
	- Elevated D dimer
	- Thrombocytopenia
	- (Late-stage) decreased fibrinogen
## Complications
- Poor prognosis
- Organ failure
## Treatment
- **Treat the underlying disease.**
- Bleeding - FFP
- Low fibrinogen - cryoprecipitate
