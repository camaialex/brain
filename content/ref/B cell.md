# B-Cell

## Lineage
- Pan-hematopoietic: [[CD45|CD45]]+
	- B-cell: [[marker_cd19|CD19]]+, [[CD20]]+
## Development
- Undergo _negative selection_ to ensure [[immune tolerance]]
### Bone Marrow
1. B cell differentiates from HSC
2. B cell rearranges V(D)J regions of BCR heavy chain ([[pre-B cell]])
3. B cell externalizes pre-BCR with surrogate light chains ([[large B cell]])
	   "Manufacturing test" to make sure BCR is stable
5. B cell internalizes and degrades pre-BCR
6. B cell rearranges VJ regions of BCR light chain ([[small B cell]])
7. B cell expresses IgM BCR
8. B cell undergoes first round of **negative selection** against self-reactive BCR
9. Surviving [[immature B cell]]s (aka [[transitional B cell]]s) express IgM
10. B cell leaves bone marrow
### Spleen
1. B cell undergoes second round of **negative selection** in the spleen
2. Surviving [[mature B cell]]s express both IgM and IgD and leave the spleen
## Subtypes
- [[plasma cell]]
- [[memory B-cell]]
## Immunology
- Process of B cell immunity
	1. [[B cell activation]]
	2. [[affinity maturation]]
	3. [[class-switching]]
- Produce [[immunoglobulin]]s as part of [[humoral immune response]]
- Expresses immunoglobulin on cell surface (BCR)
- Presents antigen using [[MHC-II]]

## Pathology
- Impaired antibody response
- [[X-linked agammaglobulinemia]] - defective [[BTK]] gene prevents pre B cell manufacturing checkpoint
- [[hyper IgM syndrome]] - defective CD40/40L removes costimulation necessary for class-switching
## Histology
- Large, dark, circular nucleus
- Very little cytoplasm (unless it's a plasma cell)
