# Platelet Count

Number of [[platelet]]s in a volume of blood.

## Methodology
### Aperture Impedance
_(Coulter Principle)_
- An aperture of known dimensions creates a **known electrical voltage**
- Platelets _change_ the voltage when they are passed through
	- Gates set based on how much they change the voltage
	- Number of voltage pulses = number of platelets
### Light Scattering
- Light sources are scattered against platelets
	- Forward scatter
	- Narrow-angle scatter
	- Wide-angle scatter
- These scatter data are correlated with the size and shape of the cell
### Fluorescence
- Antibodies against [[CD61]] expressed on platelets
## Normal Range
- Unlike some components of the blood, platelet count **does not vary by age**
- 150e09-400e09 per L
## Abnormal Ranges
- [[thrombocytopenia]]: 
- [[thrombophilia]]:
