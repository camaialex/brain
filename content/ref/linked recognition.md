(Back to [[B cell]]]])

# Linked Recognition

Linked recognition is a phenomenon in which [[B cell]]s and [[helper T cell|Th]] cells recognize **different epitopes** of the **same antigen**.
## How it Works
1. B cell binds antigen on BCR and phagocytoses
2. Antigen is processed and externalized on [[MHCII]]
3. Th cell binds MHCII antigen using its [[TCR]]. The BCR's recognition of native antigen and TCR's recognition of processed antigen are now functionally linked.
