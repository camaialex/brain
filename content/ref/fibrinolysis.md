# Fibrinolysis

End goal is **destruction of a clot** after wound healing completes
## Process
### Activation
- **t-PA** and **u-PA** secreted by endothelial cells activates **plasminogen**
	- Proceeds faster when both substrate and enzyme are bound to **fibrin** by FXIII
- Small amounts of plasmin are also generated by **contact factor** activity
	- Kallikrein
	- XIIa
	- XIa
- Plasminogen breaks down **fibrin**
### Regulation
- Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (**TAFI**) chews up plasmin binding sites on the C-terminal of **fibrin**
	- As its name suggests, activated by [[thrombin]]
- Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (**PAI-1**) sequesters **t-PA** and activated **u-PA**
- **a2 antiplasmin** directly inhibits plasmin
	- Plasmin bound to fibrin is **protected**
		- FXIII can crosslink antiplasmin to fibrin
	- Free plasmin is inhibited
	- Result is **localization of fibrinolysis to clot**
