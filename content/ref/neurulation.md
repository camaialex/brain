(Back to [[embryonic development]])

# Neurulation

- Week 3 to beginning of week 4
- Formation of neural tube
- [[caudal agenesis]] possible at this stage

## Steps in Neurulation
1. [[notochord]] extends cranially
2. Notochord signals [[neural plate]] to form in [[ectoderm]]
3. [[neural groove]] forms
4. [[neural tube]] forms and detaches from ectoderm
	- Forms cranial and caudal [[neuropore]]s
5. [[neural crest cell]]s detach from crests of neural folds
