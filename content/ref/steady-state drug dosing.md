(Back to [[pharmacokinetics]])

# Steady-State Dosing

If a condition requires constant presence of drug in the [[therapeutic window]], drug must be dosed according to how fast it _clears_ from the body

**Drugs reach steady state in 4-5 half-lives**
**Drugs clear from the body from steady-state in 4-5 half-lives**

## Maintenance Dosing
- Determined by the equation
	MD / tau = Cp * CL
- Where
	- MD = maintenance dose
	- tau = dosing frequency
	- Cp = plasma concentration
	- CL = clearance
