# Iron Overload

## Presentation
- 
## Etiology
- Potential mechanisms
	- Abnormally low hepcidin
	- Bypassing hepcidin ex. through IV iron or chronic transfusions for hemolytic anemia
	- 2/2 [[hereditary hemochromatosis]]
- Organ damage from **non-[[transferrin]] bound iron**
	- Haber-Weiss reaction
	- Fenton reaction
## Diagnosis
### Iron Studies
- Elevated [[serum iron]]
- Normal to decreased [[total iron binding capacity]]
- Elevated [[serum ferritin]]
### Liver Studies
- Biopsy (generally not recommended, invasive)
- MRI
## Complications
- [[cirrhosis]]
- liver failure
- [[arrhythmia]] and [[congestive heart failure]]
- acquired diabetes (pancreas)
- growth failure (pituitary)
## Treatment
- Excessive absorption due to low hepcidin
	- [[therapeutic phlebotomy]]
- Chronic transfusion due to anemia
	- [[iron chelation therapy]]
