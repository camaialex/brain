# Iron Metabolism
## Absorption
- Because the body has no natural elimination mechanism for iron, it controls its absorption through the hormone [[hepcidin]]
## Elimination
- The body does not have a natural excretion mechanism
- Iron loss is fixed at ~**1mg / day** by sloughing off of skin, GI mucosa, sweat
