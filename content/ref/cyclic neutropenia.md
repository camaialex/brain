# Cyclic Neutropenia

## Presentation
- 
## Etiology
- Mutation in _[ELANE]_ (neutrophil elastase)
	- Less severe than seen in [[severe congenital neutropenia]]
- Results in fall in neutrophils to a nadir of <200/mm3
- G-CSF kicks in at nadir and restores the ANC to normal levels
## Diagnosis
- Oscillating [[neutrophil]] count over cycles of 3-5 days
- Other oscillating cell lines (no impact on disease)
## Complications
- 
## Treatment
- [[G-CSF]] tamps down the oscillations
