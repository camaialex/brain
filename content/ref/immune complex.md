# Immune Complex

- [[immune complex]]es are normal Ab:Ag aggregates that must be cleared before they cause damage
## Clearance of Immune Complexes
- [[C3b]] can opsonize immune complexes
	- [[CR1]] on RBCs recognize C3b
	- RBCs carry the immune complexes to the [[liver]] or [[spleen]] for clearance by [[phagocyte]]s
