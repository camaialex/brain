# Immunoglobulin

- Otherwise known as **antibody**
- Secreted by [[B cell]]s
	- Membrane-bound form known as [[BCR]]
	- Main weapon of [[humoral immune response]]
- Each Ig binds one very specific antigen
## Structure
- Two light chains and two heavy chains
- Each chain has constant and variable regions
- Variable regions determine antigen specificity
- There are **two** identical binding sites
	- Each binding site has **affinity** to an antigen
	- Multiple binding sites per Ig increases its **avidity** to an antigen
## Mechanisms of Immunity
- Direct neutralization of pathogen
- [[opsonization]] (facilitate phagocytosis)
	- Relies on [[FcR]] expressed on phagocytes
- [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity]]
	- Relies on [[FcR]] expressed on NK cells
- Activation of complement
## Subtypes
- [[IgA]]
- [[IgD]]
- [[IgE]]
- [[IgG]]
- [[IgM]]
