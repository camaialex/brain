# Immunoglobulin

- Otherwise known as **antibody**
- Secreted by [[B cell]]s
	- Membrane-bound form known as [[BCR]]
	- Main weapon of [[humoral immune response]]
- Each Ig binds one very specific antigen
## Structure
- Two light chains and two heavy chains
- Each chain has constant and variable regions
- Variable regions determine antigen specificity
## Mechanisms of Immunity
- Direct neutralization of pathogen
- [[opsonization]] (facilitate phagocytosis, [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity]])
- Activation of complement
## Subtypes
- [[IgA]]
- [[IgD]]
- [[IgE]]
