# Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)

## Structure
- The NMJ is a specialized type of [[synapse]] between a [[neuron]] axon terminal and a muscle.
- The junction is also called the **motor end plate**
## NMJ Action Potential
1. Action potential depolarization reaches the end of the presynaptic axon
2. Depolarization opens [[voltage-gated calcium channel]]s
3. Calcium floods into the presynaptic axon
4. Vesicles containing [[acetylcholine]] are triggered to bind to the axonal membrane
5. ACh enters the synaptic cleft
	   _[[acetylcholinesterase]] degrades a lot of the ACh before it reaches receptor.._
6. ACh binds the post-synaptic [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s on muscle
7. Nicotinic receptors open, allowing positive ions to enter muscle
8. Muscle depolarizes down [[T-tubules]]
9. Sarcoplasmic reticulum triggered to release calcium into cell
10. Muscle undergoes [[muscle contraction]]
11. **Termination** of signal by [[acetylcholinesterase]]
