# Neutrophil

(back to [[phagocyte]], [[granulocyte]])

## Lineage
-  In mice: 
	- [[CD11b|CD11b]]+ 
		- All neutrophils: [[Ly-6G|Ly6G]]+
			- Some neutrophils: [[Ly6C|Ly6C]]+
## Immunology
- **First responders** to site of infection
- [[phagocyte]] - phagocytose pathogens
- [[granulocyte]] - granules contain cytotoxic factors that assist with killing
- Constitutively express [[CAM]]s necessary for extravasation
## Development
- [[granulopoiesis]] takes ~2 weeks
- Neutrophils are stored in the marrow for **5-7 days**
- Neutrophils have a [[blood]] half-life of **6-10 hours**
- Neutrophils have a tissue half-life of **1-2 days**
	- Once in the tissue neutrophils cannot go back into the blood
## Function
### Margination
- Neutrophils in the blood exist in equilibrium between the [[circulating granulocyte pool]] and the [[marginal granulocyte pool]]
- Factors that increase margination:
	- Endotoxin
	- Viral infection
	- Hemodialysis
- Factors that decrease margination:
	- Exercise
	- Epinephrine
	- [[corticosteroid]]s
### Diapedesis
1. Margination
2. Rolling
	1. Neutrophil surface [[sialyl-Lewis X-modified glycoprotein]] interactions with [[selectin]]s
3. Activation
	1. [[cytokine]]-stimulated expression of neutrophil surface [[integrin]]s
4. Adhesion
	1. Adhesion of neutrophil [[integrin]] with [[ICAM-1]] on endothelium
5. Diapedesis
6. Chemotaxis
	1. [[integrin]] mediated navigation
### Phagocytosis
### Degranulation
Granules are produced in reverse degranulation order
1. [[primary granules]] (azurophilic granules) - kills
	1. [[myeloperoxidase]]
2. [[secondary granules]] - iron sequestration
	1. [[lactoferrin]] - chelates iron
3. [[tertiary granules]] - chemotaxis
	1. [[gelatinase]] - remodels tissue
4. [[secretory vesicles]] - homing
	1. [[CR1]]
	2. [[FcR]] (gamma)
### Respiratory Burst
1. O2 is converted to HOCl by a series of enzymes
	1. [[NADPH oxidase]] (superoxide)
	2. [[superoxide dismutase]] (hydrogen peroxide)
	3. [[myeloperoxidase]] (HOCl)
## Pathology
- Susceptibility to [[catalase test]] positive organisms
- [[chronic granulomatous disease]]
- [[leukocyte adhesion defect 1]]
- [[leukocyte adhesion defect 2]]
- [[leukocyte adhesion defect 3]]
- [[hyper IgE syndrome]]
- [[Chediak-Higashi Syndrome]]
- [[myeloperoxidase deficiency]]
## Histology
- Hypersegmented nuclei
- Weakly eosinophilic cytosol
- Eosinophilic and basophilic granules
