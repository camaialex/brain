# Reticulocyte Count

Reticulocyte count provides information about bone marrow [[erythropoiesis]]
## Normal Range
- Reticulocytes make up ~1% of the total blood cells
	- Represents turnover of senescent RBC
## Interpretation
- **Elevated** - suggests that [[bone marrow]] is trying to replace lost RBCs
	- Common in [[hemolytic anemia]]
- **Inappropriately low** - in anemia, reticulocyte count should be raised as [[bone marrow]] attempts to compensate for loss. If the count remains low, the marrow is struggling to produce RBCs
	- Occurs in [[underproduction anemia]] with insufficient materials
	- Occurs in [[hemolytic anemia]] when bone marrow reserves are depleted
## Reticulocyte Index
- Calculation that accounts for underlying anemia and maturation of reticulocytes in blood
	- Calculated using $$RI = \frac{reticCount}{maturationFactor}*\frac{patientHgb}{referenceHgb}$$
	- Where maturation factor is usually 2.
### Interpretation
- 1.0: No anemia
- 1.5: Mild anemia
- 2.0: Moderate anemia
- <2.0: Inadequate response to anemia
- 2.5: Severe anemia
- >3.0: Appropriate response to anemia
