# Starling Forces

Starling forces are the determinants of **how fluid moves between the vasculature and interstitial space**.
## Types of Starling forces
- **Hydrostatic pressure** from the heart raises pressure in the vasculature and pushes fluid _towards lower pressure_ in the interstitium.
- **Oncotic (osmotic/colloid) pressure** from the increased protein concentration in the plasma pulls fluid _towards higher osmolarity_ in the vasculature
	- [[plasma]] has more protein than [[interstitial fluid]] because large proteins cannot be pushed out of the vessels.
## Equation
- Net filtration = Kf[(Pc - Pi) - σ(∏c - ∏i)]
	- **Kf** = filtration coefficient (determined by properties of vessel - pores)
	- **Pc, Pi** = hydrostatic pressure in the capillary, interstitium
	- **∏c, ∏i** = oncotic pressure in the capillary, interstitium
	- **σ** = protein reflection coefficient, permeability of protein
## Outcomes
- [[edema]]/[[effusion]]
	- Rise in hydrostatic pressure
	- Fall in oncotic pressure
	- Increase in vascular permeability
