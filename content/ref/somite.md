# Somite

Somites are masses of [[paraxial mesoderm]] that form after neurulation.
## Somite Differentiation
1. Somites and larger cranial [[somitomere]] form
2. Medial aspects of somites differentiate into [[sclerotome]]; lateral aspects differentiate into **dermomyotome**
3. Neurogenesis from the neural crest and neural tube innervates dermomyotome
4. Sclerotome begins extending **lateral processes** which splits dermomyotome into epiblastic and hypoblastic myotome; dermatome separates and moves laterally
5. Innervation forms the dorsal and ventral roots leading to the spinal nerves
6. Each sclerotome is split by the developing spinal nerves
7. The bottom half of each sclerotome fuses with the top half of the sclerotome below it; the top of the C1 sclerotome fuses with the developing skull
