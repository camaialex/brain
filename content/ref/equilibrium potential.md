(Back to [[resting membrane potential]])

# Equilibrium Potential

## Definition
**The equilibrium potential of an ion** is the potential of the membrane **AS IF the ion in question were the ONLY ONE in the system**.
## Chemistry
- An ion will travel _down_ its concentration gradient
- Eventually, this movement is resisted by the **electrochemical gradient** as charges become unbalanced
- The equilibrium between the concentration and EC gradients is the equilibrium potential
## Calculation
- Calculated using the **Nernst Equation**
	$E_{ion} = -\frac{RT}{zF} ln\frac{[in]}{[out]}$
## Common Examples
- **K+** wants to move _out_ the cell; it has a negative ~**-80mV** membrane potential
- **Na+** wants to move _into_ the cell; it has a positive ~**+55mV** membrane potential
- **Cl-** wants to move _into_ the cell; it has a negative ~**-75mV** membrane potential
