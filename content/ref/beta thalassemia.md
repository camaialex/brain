# Beta Thalassemia

**Presentation**
- Description

## Etiology
- [[beta thalassemia minor]] (trait): any mutation in 1/2 [[beta globin]] genes
	- [[hemoglobin E disease]] is a special subtype caused by homozygous HbE mutation
- [[beta thalassemia intermedia]]: two abnormal beta globin genes but at least 1 functional
- [[beta thalassemia major]] (Cooley's Anemia): both beta globin genes nonfunctional
Can be due to the following mutations:
- [[beta+ thalassemia]]: reduced production of beta globin
	- Heterozygous for nonfunctional/functional beta Hb chain
- [[beta0 thalassemia]]: no production of beta-globin
	- Homozygous for nonfunctional beta Hb chain
- HbE mutation: reduced production of beta-globin
	- Due to "Hemoglobin E" which functions but has unstable transcript
