(Back to [[complement system]])

# Classical Complement Pathway

## Process
1. [[C1q]] binds to [[IgM]] or [[IgG]]
2. C1q recruits [[C1r]] and [[C1s]], forming [[C1qr2s2]]
3. C1qr2s2 cleaves [[C2]] and [[C4]], forming [[C3 convertase]] (C4b2a)
4. C3 convertase converts [[C3]] to [[C3b]], releasing anaphylatoxin [[C3a]]
5. C3 convertase associates with one C3b to become [[C5 convertase]] (C4b2a3b)
6. C5 convertase converts [[C5]] to [[C5b]], releasing anaphylatoxin [[C5a]]
7. C5b associates with C6-9 to form the [[membrane attack complex]]
