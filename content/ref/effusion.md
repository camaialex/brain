# Effusion

The leakage of [[interstitial fluid]] into membrane-lined spaces due to unbalanced [[Starling forces]] which exceeds the lymphatic system's ability to scavenge it.
## Types of Effusion
- [[exudate]]  - water and stuff that isn't supposed to be there (bacteria, pus, blood)
	- Usually caused by inflammation driven by disease process
- [[transudate]] - mostly water
	- Usually caused by increased hydrostatic pressure
- [[ascites]] - special type of effusion that occurs in the [[peritoneum]]
