# T Cell Receptor (TCR)

The TCR is a membrane-bound receptor expressed on [[T cell]]s.
## Structure
- Resembles Fab (Fragment antigen binding) fragment of a [[BCR]]
- Alpha and beta chains
- Subdivisions (1 per chain)
	- Variable regions
	- Joining regions
	- Diversity regions
	- Constant regions
## Function
- Very high affinity for one (theoretical) antigen
- High degree of diversity achieved by **V(D)J** recombination
- Transmits signals through [[CD3]] molecule
