# RBC Count

The total count of [[erythrocyte|RBC]]s in a volume of blood.
## Measurement
### Aperture Impedance
_(Coulter Principle)_
- An aperture of known dimensions creates a **known electrical voltage**
- RBCs _change_ the voltage when they are passed through
	- Gates set based on how much they change the voltage
	- Number of voltage pulses = number of RBCs
- Potential problems
	- RBCs come back the way they came
	- RBCs clump and create a very large pulse
### Light Scattering
- Light sources are scattered against RBCs
	- Forward scatter
	- Narrow-angle scatter
	- Wide-angle scatter
- These scatter data are correlated with the size and shape of the cell
## Normal Range
- This will vary by lab
- Typically, normal RBC counts range from 4.7E12 to 6.1E6 per uL
