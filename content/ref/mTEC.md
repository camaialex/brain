# Medullary Thymic Epithelial Cells

## Function
- Express **MHC** to _negatively_ select against _self-reactive_ T cells
- mTECs express the transcription factor [[AIRE]] which allows expression of diverse tissue-specific proteins
- mTECs express a gamut of different self-antigens:
	- A [[T cell]] that reacts to these antigens is given a death signal OR
	- T cells may alternatively give rise to [[Treg cell|Treg]] cells.
