(Back to [[pharmacokinetics]])

# Absorption

- Getting the drug into the [[plasma compartment]]
## Bioavailability
- Measured as [[F]] (fraction bioavailable)
- Most bioavailable: 
	- IV, sQ, IM, sublingual, transdermal
- Intermediate bioavailable:
	- Rectal
- Least bioavailable: 
	- Oral, inhaled
## Rate of Absorption
- Fastest:
	- IV, inhalation
- Fast:
	- Sublingual, injections
- Slow:
	- Oral, rectal
- Slowest:
	- Transdermal, depots, oral (enteric-coated)
## Routes of Administration
### Enteral - via GI system
- [[oral]]
- [[rectal]]
### Parenteral - bypass GI system
- Skin
	- [[transdermal]]
- Mucosa
	- [[rectal]]
	- [[buccal]]
	- [[sublingual]]
- Injection
	- [[intravenous]]
	- [[intramuscular]]
	- [[subcutaneous]]
	- [[intradermal]]
- Respiratory
	- [[inhalation]]
- For local effect
	- [[aural]]
	- [[dermal]]
	- [[intranasal]]
	- [[pharyngeal]]
	- [[vaginal]]
