# Splenectomy
Splenectomy is the removal of the [[spleen]]
## Indications
### Anemia
- Splenectomy is indicated for splenomegaly and splenic sequestration related to:
	- [[hereditary spherocytosis]]
	- [[pyruvate kinase deficiency]]
	- [[immune thrombocytopenia]]
	- [[warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]
	- [[iron overload]] in the setting of transfusion-dependent [[thalassemia]]
### Other Indications
- Splenic trauma
- Splenic abscesses
- Splenic cysts
- Splenic artery aneurysm
- Splenic angioma
## Risks and Benefits
### Risks
- Sepsis from encapsulated bacteria
	- [[Neisseria meningitidis]]
	- [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]
	- [[Haemophilus influenzae]]
- Infection from parasites
	- [[Plasmodium falciparum]] - malaria
	- [[Babesia microti]] - babesiosis
	- [[Anaplasma phagocytophilum]] - ehrlichiosis
- Post-operative risk of deep [[venous thrombosis]]
- [[pulmonary hypertension]]
### Potential Benefits
- Improvement of anemia due to removal of splenic sequestration
- Improvement of transfusion dependence
## Post-splenectomy Prophylaxis
- Due to increased risk of infection, antibiotic prophylaxis after splenectomy especially in young patients should be considered
	- [[penicillins]]
	- [[cephalosporins]] or [[macrolides]] for penicillin-allergic
	- **Children** should get antibiotics until age 5 and 1-3 years post surgery
	- **Adults** should get antibiotics 1-3 years post-surgery
	- **History of sepsis or severe infection** should get lifelong prophylaxis
- Vaccination is essential
	- Deferral of splenectomy until **2 years of age**
	- Vaccination 10-12 weeks in advance of surgery
		- [[Neisseria meningitidis]]
		- [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]
		- [[Haemophilus influenzae]]
