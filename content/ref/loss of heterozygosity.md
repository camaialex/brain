# Loss of Heterozygosity

LoH is the process by which a precancerous cell loses the **normal copy** of a gene, resulting in **hemizygous** or **homozygous** expression of a mutant allele
## Mechanisms of LoH
- [[recombination]] during mitosis
- [[deletion mutation]]
- [[epigenetic silencing]]
- Another mutation
