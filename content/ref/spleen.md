(Back to [[secondary lymphatic organs]])

# Spleen

## Function
- Filtration of blood (of pathogens, damaged cells, debris)
- Capture of antigen from **circulation/blood**
- [[B cell]] maturation
- Lymphoid interactions

## Structure
- **White pulp**: site of immune interactions
	- Not connected to lymph!
	- [[B cell]] follicles
	- **Periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS):** [[T-cells]] reside
- **Red pulp**: site of blood filtration

## Pathology
- Increased risk of [[bacteremia]]
- Susceptibility to _encapsulated_ bacteria
