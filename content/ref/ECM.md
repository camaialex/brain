# Extracellular Matrix

## Fibers
- **Collagen fibers**
	- Histology: Long, thick, strong fibers
	- Function: Tensile strength
- **Elastic fibers**
	- Histology: Spidery, thin, long fibers
	- Function: Rebound after distention
- **Reticular fibers**
	- Histology: Short, fine, do not show up unless specially stained
	- Function: Form network for cells to adhere to and create tissues

## Ground Substance
- **Proteoglycans**
- **Glycoproteins**
- **Glycosaminoglycans**

## Fluids
- Also called "interstitial fluid"
- Mostly water
- Similar to plasma
