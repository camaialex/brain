(Back to [[hypersensitivity reactions]])

# Type I Hypersensitivity Reaction

Type I HRs are mediated by [[mast cell]]s and [[IgE]]. They are also colloquially called "[[allergy]]"
## Process
1. Exposure to allergen activates [[Th2]] cells
2. Th2 cells stimulate [[B cell]] proliferation
3. B cells secrete [[IgE]]
4. [[Mast cell]]s use [[FcR]] to bind IgE
5. Mast cells use IgE to bind/crosslink allergen and degranulate
## Possible Symptoms
1. Vasodilation
2. Edema
3. (rarely) Anaphylaxis
