# Iron Balance

## Physiological Iron
- The human body has **4g** of iron
- The human body loses **1mg** per day

## Absorption
- Iron is absorbed in the [[duodenum]]
	- Animal products: heme iron
	- Non-animal products: non-heme iron
- Absorption is facilitated by
	- [[vitamin C]]
	- Presence of heme iron
- Absorption is inhibited by precipitation
	- Calcium
	- Phytates
	- Polyphenols
### Process of Absorption
- Ferric iron is reduced by [[duodenal cytochrome B]]
- Ferrous iron is transported via [[DMT1]]
