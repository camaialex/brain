# G-protein coupled receptor

## Structure
- Receptor protein
	- 7-pass integral protein
- G-protein
	- Alpha, beta, gamma subunits
## Function
1. Ligand binds receptor
2. Galpha subunit binds [[GTP]] and dissociates from beta and gamma subunits
3. Galpha-GTP activates second messengers
## Subtypes
- Vary by G-protein alpha subunit
	- [[Gq]]
	- [[Gs]]
	- [[Gi]]
## Related Pathways
- [[Wnt-beta-catenin signaling]]
- Complement anaphylatoxin receptors [[C3aR]] and [[C5aR]]
