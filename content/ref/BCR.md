# B Cell Receptor

The BCR is a surface receptor expressed on [[B cell]]s.
## Structure
- Heavy chain
	- Variable region
	- 2 diversity regions
	- 1 joining region
	- Constant region
- Light chain
	- Variable region
	- Joining region
	- Constant region
## Function
- Transmits signals through [[Ig alpha]] and [[Ig beta]] signaling molecules
- Diversity is maintained by random combinations of V, D, and J segments mediated by RAG proteins
- **Unique to BCR (compared to TCR and MHC) is its ability to recognize NATIVE antigen**
	- To be compatible with TCR and MHC, it exhibits [[linked recognition]]
