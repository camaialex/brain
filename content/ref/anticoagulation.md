# Anticoagulation/Fibrinolysis

End goal is **inhibition** of the clotting chain reaction
## Process
- Activates as soon as clot forms
	- Constantly degrading to keep the thrombin burst in check
### Serpins (antithrombin)
- Serine protease inhibitors esp. [[antithrombin]] inhibit serine proteases
	- FII (only with HMW heparin)
	- FVII
	- FIX
	- FX (HMW and LMW heparin)
	- FXI
	- FXII
- Antithrombin directly and irreversibly binds the active site
	- Cofactor [[heparin]] (drug) or [[heparan sulfate]] (endogenous) induces the necessary conformational change, allowing it to inhibit **FXa**
	- HMW heparin can also hold the antithrombin against **thrombin** while LMW cannot
### Thrombomodulin
- [[thrombomodulin]] directly binds **thrombin** and inhibits it
### Protein C/S
- Circulating [[protein C]] is activated by the [[thrombin]]-thrombomodulin **(protein C-ase) complex**
- Activated protein C (APC) binds **Protein S** as a cofactor on a membrane surface
	- Protein S circulates bound to complement protein C4bBP
- Protein C inhibits key **cofactors**
	- FVa
	- FVIIIa
### Other inhibitors
- Tissue factor pathway inhibitor **TFPI**
	- Associates with **FXa**
	- Rapid inactivation of **FVIIa**
- Alpha2-macroglobulin
	- "Baits" proteinases with a substrate-like region
	- Rapidly traps proteinase within itself upon proteolysis
## Resting Anticoagulation
- When there is no injury, the endothelium [[prevents]] coagulation from occurring
- Expression of anticoagulation proteins
	- Heparan sulfate
	- Thrombomodulin
	- TFPI
## Vitamin K
- Vitamin K is required for **carboxylation** of several key factors in coagulation
	- [[Protein C]]
		- Important implication: Protein C's short half life means that it is the first to be depleted during Warfarin therapy, leading to transient _hypercoagulable_ state
	- [[Protein S]]
## Defects
- [[Factor V Leiden]] - resistance of FVa to APC degradation
- [[antithrombin deficiency]]
- [[Protein C deficiency]]
- [[Protein S deficiency]]
- [[vitamin K deficiency]] - affects C, S
