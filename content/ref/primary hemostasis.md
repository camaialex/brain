# Primary Hemostasis

The **end goal** is the formation of an aggregated **platelet plug** composed of [[platelet]]s bound to the injury and to each other.
## Process
### Initiation
- Activation is dependent on calcium
- Activation is stimulated by 
	- [[ADP]]
	- [[epinephrine]]
	- [[thrombin]]
	- [[von Willebrand factor]]
	- [[ref/collagen|collagen]]
- Endothelium releases vWF from [[Weibel-Palade bodies]]
### Adherence
- Platelet must stick to the site of injury
	- [[GP1b]] - **initial binding to vWF**
	- [[GPIb-V-IX]] - vWF and collagen
	- [[GPVI]] - collagen
	- [[GPIa-IIa]] - collagen
### Spreading/Activation
- Platelet spreads out
- Platelet degranulates
	- ADP
	- TBXA - vasoconstriction
	- Externalization of PS
### Aggregation
- Platelet must stick to other platelets
	- [[GPIIb-IIIa]] - vWF, **talin**, and then fibrinogen
### Stimulation of Secondary Hemostasis
- Platelet must facilitate fibrin mesh formation
	- [[phosphatidylserine]] externalization - binds intrinsic Xase
## Defects
- Defects in **primary hemostasis** are problems with platelet function
	- [[ref/Bernard-Soulier syndrome|Bernard-Soulier syndrome]] - issue with Gp1b that prevents adhesion
	- [[Glanzmann's thrombasthenia]] - issue with GpIIa-IIIb that prevents aggregation
- Drug-induced platelet dysfunction
	- [[aspirin]] and other COX-2 inhibitors inhibits TXA2 synthesis
- [[von Willebrand disease]]
- [[immune thrombocytopenia]]
### Presentation
- Results in [[mucocutaneous bleeding]]
	- [[epistaxis]]
	- [[petichiae]]/[[purpura]]
	- [[menorrhagia]] (heavy menses)
