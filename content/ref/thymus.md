(Back to [[primary lymphatic organs]])

# Thymus

## Location
- _Medial_
- _Superior_ to the heart
- _Deep_ to the sternum
## Function
- Site of **thymocyte** maturation into [[T cell]]s
	- Positive selection of **HLA-reactive** cells: can the T-cell bind self-HLA?
		- Orchestrated by [[cTEC]] cells
		- "Goldilocks" effect
			- Under-reactive cells die by neglect
			- Moderately reactive cells receive survival signal
			- Over-reactive cells receive death signal
	- Maintenance of **immune tolerance**; negative selection against _self-reactive_ cells
		- Orchestrated by [[mTEC]] cells
- Most active in childhood and degenerates with age
## Structure
- Multilobar structure containing many pockets of lymphocytes
- ?? corpuscules - keratin pearls 

## Pathologies
- Hypoplastic thymus
	- [[SCID]]
	- [[DiGeorge Syndrome]]
