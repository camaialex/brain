# Genomic Imprinting

Genomic imprinting occurs when **one of two** copies of a region of DNA is methylated, inactivating it
- Depends on **parent of origin**
	- Paternally imprinted: paternal copy is silenced
	- Maternally imprinted: maternal copy is silenced

## Disorders of Genomic Imprinting
- Deletions, mutations, or epigenetic errors in imprinted regions may or may not be expressed based on parent of origin

## Examples of Disorders
- [[Prader-Willi Syndrome]]
- [[Angelman Syndrome]]
- [[Russell-Silver Syndrome]]
- [[Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome]]
