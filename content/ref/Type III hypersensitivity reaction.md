(Back to [[hypersensitivity reactions]])

# Type III Hypersensitivity Reaction

Type III HRs are mediated by antibody-antigen [[immune complex]]es
## Process
1. **Antigenic excess** creates excessive amounts of small immune complexes
2. These immune complexes are hard to clear and overload capacity of complement
3. Complexes deposit in blood vessels and induce complement to cause tissue damage
## Pathologies
- [[SLE]] - immune complex-mediated disease
- [[Arthus reaction]] - patients sensitized to drug will react to subsequent injections
- [[serum sickness]] - foreign serum proteins cause complex deposition
