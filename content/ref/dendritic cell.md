# Dendritic Cell

(back to [[APC]])

## Lineage
- - Pan-hematopoietic: [[CD45\|CD45]]+
	- !Neutrophil: [[Ly-6G\|Ly6G]]-
		- [[Ly6C|Ly6C]]+
			- [[marker_mhcii\|MHCII]]-high
## Immunology
- Begin as phagocytes but _switch_ to APC functionality
- After phagocytosis, display antigen on [[MHC-II]]
- Travel along [[lymphatic vessels]] towards [[secondary lymphatic organs]]
	- In search of [[helper T cell]] with cognate [[TCR]]
	- Lymphocyte costimulatory molecules:
		- [[CD80]]
		- [[CD86]]
		- [[CD40]]
## Pathology
- Impaired activation of adaptive immune system
## Histology
- Requires special stains
