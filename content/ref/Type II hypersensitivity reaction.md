(Back to [[hypersensitivity reactions]])

# Type II Hypersensitivity Reaction

Type II HRs are mediated by [[IgM]] or [[IgG]] against a perceived foreign antigen. Often arise as transfusion reactions
## Process
1. Target cell antigens stimulates B cell activity
2. Target cell is crosslinked by [[IgM]] or [[IgG]]
3. Bound antibody can kill cell in one of two ways:
	- [[classical complement pathway]] activation
	- [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity]] by [[NK cell]]s
## Pathologies
- [[transfusion reaction]]s - foreign ABO antigen
- [[erythroblastosis fetalis]] - foreign Rh antigen
- [[hemolytic anemia]]
- [[rheumatic heart disease]] - antigen confusion between M protein and myosin in heart
