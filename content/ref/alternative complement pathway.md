# Alternative Complement Pathway

## Process
1. [[C3]] spontaneously hydrolyzes into [[C3b]], releasing anaphylatoxin [[C3a]]
2. C3 binds [[Factor B]], forming [[C3bB]]
3. Factor B cleaves, releasing Factor D and forming [[C3 convertase]] (C3bBb)
4. C3bBb converts C3 to C3b
5. C3bBb binds C3b, becoming [[C5 convertase]] (C3bBb3b)
6. C5 convertase converts [[C5]] to [[C5b]], releasing anaphylatoxin [[C5a]]
7. C5b associates with C6-9 to form the [[membrane attack complex]]
