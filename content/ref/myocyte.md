(Back to [[skeletal muscle]])

# Myocyte

Myocytes are **multinucleate** skeletal cells
## Development
- Myocytes develop from end-to-end fusion of [[myoblast]]s
## Structure
- Sarcolemma - cell membrane
	- Dystrophin
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum
## Histology
- _Peripherally-located_, multiple nuclei per cell
- Strongly eosinophilic
- Long, sausage-shaped nuclei (not flattened)
- Stains for membrane [[dystrophin]] - stabilizes sarcolemma
