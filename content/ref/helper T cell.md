# Helper T-Cell

## Lineage
- 
## Subtypes
- [[Th1 cell|Th1]]
- [[follicular helper T-cell|Tfh]]
- [[Th2]]
- [[Th17]]
- [[Treg cell]]
## Immunology
- Stimulated by binding [[TCR]] to [[MHC-II]] on [[APC]]s
	- *Signal 1:* MHC:Ag :: TCR
	- *Signal 2:* Costimulatory protein :: CD28
	- Activation triggers IL-2 autocrine signaling
- Stimulates activation and proliferation of cognate [[cytotoxic T cell]]s and [[B cell]]s
