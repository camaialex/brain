# Welcome
This repo is basically medical school Wikipedia. It was designed with the idea of creating a dynamic knowledge base instead of a virtual folder full of notes that would end up getting deleted after school is over.

Each note is connected to several others through a series of wiki-links to allow intersections between organ systems, biochemical pathways, and diseases. This way of taking notes more closely resembles the actual web of scientific knowledge that we work with every day in medicine.

## How to Study
- **Self-assessment**: Summon a random note, collapse all sections, and re-do the notes
- **Connections**: Highlight a random graph node and explain all the connections to neighboring nodes
