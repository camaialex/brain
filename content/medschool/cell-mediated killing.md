# Cell-Mediated Killing

[[cytotoxic T cell|Tk]] cells induce apoptosis in infected cells after detecting foreign antigen on [[MHC-I]]
## Process
- Death receptor binding
	- Target cell [[Fas]] binds T cell [[FasL]]
	- Engages enzymatic action to cleave [[caspase 8]]
- Degranulation
	- [[perforin]] proteins form pores in cell membrane
		- Ca2+ dependent manner
	- [[granzymes]] gain entry into cell and cleave [[caspase 3]]
## Pathology
- [[Cancer Atlas|Cancer]] can suppress the activity of CD8s in several ways
- CD8 T-cells can engage in autoimmunity: [[type 1 diabetes]]
